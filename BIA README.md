# U.S. Consumer Behavior Under Inflation (2015-2025)

## 📊 Project Overview
This Business Intelligence project analyzes the structural shift in American household savings and spending habits following the 2021-2022 inflationary spike. By synthesizing macro-economic data, I identified a **$1.61 Billion cumulative savings shortfall** and visualized the "Scissor Effect" that has redefined the modern consumer landscape.

## 🚀 Key Insights
* **The $1.61B Savings Gap**: Since 2021, households have under-saved by over $1.61 Billion compared to the 10-year historical baseline.
* **The Scissor Effect**: Identified the critical pivot point in early 2022 where the cost of living (Inflation) officially surpassed the personal saving rate.
* **The Debt Pivot**: Documented the direct correlation between the decline in personal savings and the surge in high-interest consumer debt.
* **Purchasing Power Trap**: As of 2025, real purchasing power remains stagnant; spending growth is almost entirely offset by the cost of living.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Power BI**: Data modeling, DAX measure creation, and Executive Dashboard design.
* **Data Transformation**: Cleaned and normalized Year-over-Year (YoY) growth metrics for Inflation, Spending, and Debt.
* **Analytical Framework**: Applied a "Regime/Era" analysis to compare Pre-Pandemic stability vs. Post-Inflation volatility.

### 💡 Strategic Summary Slide
This slide synthesizes the technical data into three actionable pillars: the erosion of the 2020 surplus, the debt-for-savings trade-off, and the purchasing power trap.

## 🏁 Conclusion
The analysis proves that the "New Normal" for the U.S. consumer is a high-debt, low-savings environment. The record 31.8% savings surplus of 2020 has been completely eroded, leaving households more vulnerable to economic shocks in 2026 and beyond.
